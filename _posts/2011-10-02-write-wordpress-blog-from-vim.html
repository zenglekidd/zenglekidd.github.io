<p>This is my first time to use <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3510" title="vimrepress" target="_blank">vimrepress</a>. A plugin that can let you wirte blog directly from vim.</p>
<p>There are some command I use in this post</p>
<ul>
<li>:BlogList -- show all posts you have in vim</li>
<li>:BlogSave publish -- publish you post to wordpress</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem I meet right now is that I can edit some old post from vim , but can not wirte a new post directly. Is there anyone know how can I solve this problem? <a style="font-size:10px;">(solved by myself)</a></p>
<p>The format of this post is html, but the default setting is something named markdown. I really do not know what is that... I'll try to understand and post some words abot markdown in my next post.</p>
<p><a style="font-size:15px;">Problem solved: (about new post)</a><br />
When I use the command BlogNew, I keep filling in a number in "StrID" which cause a problem. This time I just leave StrID blank, the system give a ID automatic. Conculison: When use BlogNew, leave "StrID" as blank!!</p>
