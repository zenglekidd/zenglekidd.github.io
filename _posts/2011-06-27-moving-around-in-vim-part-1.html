<p>Moving around in vim is a basic but import thing. In my mind, if you can move to the place you want to insert a word, you are in the right track to use vim. please get ride of "up,down,left,right" arrow and use "h,j,k,l"<br />
The most basic movement is showed in the picture below:h,j,k,l<br />
<img src="assets/180px-Hjkl.png" alt="" /><br />
also you can add a number before them like: 2h, 5j to repeat several times<br />
^ ---- start of line<br />
$ ---- end of line<br />
ctrl-b  ----one screen backward<br />
ctrl-f  ----one screen forward<br />
G ---- end of a file<br />
gg---- start of a file<br />
H ---- first line of the screen-<br />
M ---- middle of the screen<br />
L ---- last line of the screen<br />
ctrl -o ---- start a new line after this line<br />
ctrl -O ---- start a new line before this line<br />
w ---- next word<br />
e ---- end of word<br />
b ---- back one word</p>
<p>this is the notes for today, tomorrow Moving around part 2 about<br />
sentences, paragraph and change between upper case and lower case</p>
<h2>This is a test from vimrepress.</h2>
